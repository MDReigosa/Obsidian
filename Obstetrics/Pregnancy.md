Diagnosis
amenorrhea,breast tenderness, urinary frequency, and fatigue

	G: total number of pregnancy of any gestation (includes moles)
	T: number of term deliveries (>37w GA)
	P:number of preterm deliveries (20+0 to 36+6w GA)
	A:number of abortions and ectopic pregnancies (ending <20w GA)
	L: number of living children

Clinical:
uterine enlargement
breast engorgement
goodwells sign: softening of the cervix 4-6w GA
Chadwick sign: blush vascularization of the cervix (6w GA)
Hegar sign: softenign of the cervical isthmus (6-8w GA)

Lab
bhCG: 9 d post-conception, positive in urine 28 d after 1st day of LMP
β-hCG Rule of 10s
	10 IU at time of missed menses
	100000 IU at 10 wk GA (peak)
	10000 IU at term
(less levels can suggest ectopic/abortion)
(higher levels: multiple gestation/mole/21 trisomy)
US: 
transvaginal: 
	5 wk GA: gestational sac visible
	6 wk GA: fetal pole visible
	6-8 wk GA: fetal heart activity visible (FHR visible after 6 weeks on TVUS)
Trimesters: 
	T1 (first trimester): 1-14 wk GA
	T2 (second trimester): 14-28 wk GA
	T3 (third trimester): 28-42 wk GA
	Normal pregnancy term: 37-42 wk GA

Maternal changes during pregnancy
	Hematology: hemodilution (anemia)
	leukocytosis (improvement of autoinmune diseases)
	thrombocytopenia (>70000) asymptomatic, normalizes within 2-12w
	hypercoagulable state: risk

Antepartum
	3-8 wk GA is a critical period of organogenesis, so early preparation is vital
	all patients 0.4 mg/d of folic acid

Prenatal visit
	within 8-12 wk of the 1st day of LMP or earlier if <20 or >35 y/o,
	Gestational age:
		Naegele’s rule: 1st day of LMP + 1 yr + 7 d – 3 mo
	BMI (implicates preeclampsia DVT, GDM)
	Investigation: CBC, group rh, urine (screen bacteriuria), pelvic exam

Subsequent visits
	For uncomplicated pregnancies, SOGC recommends q4-6 wk GA until 30 wk, q2-3 wk from 30 wk GA, and q1-2 wk from 36 wk GA until delivery

>Physical exam: BP, weight gain, SFH (symphisis fundamental height), Leopold’s maneuvers (T3) to determine the lie, position, and presentation of fetus.
>If SFH
	>Dates: multiple gestastion/polihidramnios/large gestational age
	<Dates:IUGR/fetal demise/oligohydramnios

>Leopold’s Maneuvers
	• performed after 30-32 wk GA
	• first maneuver: to determine which fetal part is lying furthest away from the pelvic inlet
	• second maneuver: to determine the location of the fetal back
	• third maneuver: to determine which fetal part is lying above the pelvic inlet
	• fourth maneuver: to locate the fetal brow
