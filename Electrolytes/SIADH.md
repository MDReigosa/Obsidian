ADH secretion occurs with a fall in effective circulating volume. In these conditions, thirst and water retention are stimulated, protecting volume status at the cost of the osmolar status.

Because the renal response to volume expansion remains intact, these patients are typically euvolemic. However, because of the rise in TBW,  serum concentrations of Na+ are decreased. 

SIADH is diagnosed by the following:
Hypo-osmotic hyponatremia
Urine osmolality >100 mOsm/L
Euvolemia
The absence of conditions that stimulate ADH secretion, including volume contraction, nausea, adrenal dysfunction, and hypothyroidism.

The standard first-line therapy is water restriction
and correction of any contributing factors (nausea, pneumonia,
drugs, etc.).

If (Urine Na+ + Urine K+)/Serum Na+ <0.5, restrict to
1 L/d.
If (Urine Na+ + Urine K+)/Serum Na+ is 0.5â€“1.0, restrict to 500 mL/d.
If (Urine Na+ + Urine K+)/Serum Na+ is >1, the patient has a negative renal free water clearance, and any amount of ingested water may be retained. 
So > next options:
A high dietary solute load
Loop diuretics
Vaptanes: Conivaptan (IV) Tolvaptan (vo)
Only if nothing from above works: Lithium and demeclocycline
