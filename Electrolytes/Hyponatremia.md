<135 mEq/l

	Classification:
Pseudohyponatremia: refers to a laboratory anomaly in which high
levels of plasma proteins and/or lipids expand the nonaqueous
portion of the plasma
Hyperosmolar hyponatremia: refers to circumstances in which an
osmotically active solute other than Na+ accumulates in the ECF. hyperglucemia results in 1.6-2.4 drop Na for every 100mg up. *post–transurethral resection of the 
prostate syndrome.* Because of absorption of solutes such us glycine, mannitol, or sorbitol.
[[ADH]]: Appropriate ADH: *Hypovolemic hyponatremia*: Any cause of net Na+
loss, such as in thiazide
*Hypervolemic hyponatremia*: edematous states such as congestive heart failure (CHF), hepatic cirrhosis, and severe nephrotic syndrome
“Inappropriate” secretion of ADH:
[[SIADH]] /Pharmacologic agents: SRII,Chlorpropamide
Reset osmostat: set point of plasma osmolarity is reduce. e g pregnate woman.

DX: 
>Acute hyponatremia (i.e., developing <2 days)
>chronic hyponatremia (>3 days in duration)

Ask for: Plasma osmolality, Urine osmolality, Urine Na+

![[Pasted image 20220809235523.png]]

Treatment
Acute: A targeted rise in serum [Na+] by 4–6 mEq/L within the first 4–6 hours
Chronic hyponatremia, the target rate of correction should not exceed 8 mEq/L over 24 hours.

A 100 kg man is brought to the hospital with mental status changes and a serum Na of 110. You would like to raise his Na by 1 mEq/L over the next 4–6 hours using hypertonic saline (3% saline: 513 mEq of Na, 0 mEq of K).
Δ [Na+] = (513 mEq/L – 110 mEq/L) / (60 + 1) = 6.61 mEq/L/L of 3% saline

Rate of infusion = 1 mEq/L/h ÷ 6.61 mEq/L/L of 3% saline = 151 mL/h
Adjusted starting rate (60% of calculated): 91 mL/h

Deficit calculus:
(Desired change in Na) × TBW
where TBW is 0.6 × body weight in kg in men and 0.5 × body weight in kg in women.

For 70kg trying to raise 6mEq/L
(112 mEq/L - 106 mEq/L) × (0.6 L/kg × 70 kg) = 252 mEq/L
