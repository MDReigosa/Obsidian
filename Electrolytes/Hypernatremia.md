>145mEq/l

Loss of water
Stimuli: thirst and ADH

1. Determine if patient if oliguric (<0.5mL/min)
2. Non oliguric: 
Urine osmolaliti > 250 :: [[Diabetes insipidus DI]]
Urine osmolality > 300: Osmotic diuresis: glucose and urea

[ALGORITHM]
![[Pasted image 20220820113109.png]]

ADH:
The urine osmolality should increase by at least 50% in complete CDI and does not change in NDI.


TT
Symtomatic : no more than 10â€“12 mEq/L per day
Chronic: no more than 5 and 8 mEq/L

calculate WD: TBW (Wx0.5-0.6) (current Na/target Na - 1)
Choose fluid replacement regimen: D5W or enteral water. (never water intravenously bc of hemolysis). Carefull with hyperglucemia
rate of replacement: WD / 24hs. 
Hypovolemia is replaced with concomitant 0.9% NaCl
**0.45% saline infuses water and Nacl. 1 Lt of 0.45 % infuses 500mL of water and 500mL of isotonic saline**

Change in Na: (Na infusate - current Na) / TBW+1 in Meq/L
