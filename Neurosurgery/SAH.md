Aneurysmal rupture accounts for 85% of all SAHs, with the remaining 15% attributed to nonaneurysmal sources such as trauma, infection, vasculitis, drugs, malignancies, and the relatively benign perimesencephalic pattern SAH.
Interestingly, however, the great majority of aneurysms that do rupture are small—often less than 10 mm in size.
In disorders such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), aneurysms arise in up to 10% of patients.

Medical management:
Patients with GCS scores of 8 or less, those requiring external ventricular drainage (EVD) placement or patients at risk for early deterioration with HH scores of III or greater and Fisher grade 3 or greater are candidates for controlled, elective intubation.
Hypertension in SAH is common at presentation and is, in part, due to the adrenergic “storm". >Mantain below 160 mm Hg. Sodium nitroprusside, although efficacious, is not recommended as first-line therapy because of the risk of toxicity and elevation of intracranial pressure. USE Nicardipine and esmolol.
Seizures occur in 1 to 7% of SAH patients during this early period. >Prophylactic use of anticonvulsants, especially phenytoin,at SAH presentation is not recommended.
Approximately 25 to 30% of patients develop hydrocephalus during the early period of ICU treatment of SAH.
Mortality associated with rebleeding of aneurysmal SAH is 80%.
Antifibrinolytic therapy using agents such as epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid (TXA) showed that rebleeding could be significantly reduced but at the cost of increased rates vasospasm. Long-course therapy with EACA or TXA is not recommended.
