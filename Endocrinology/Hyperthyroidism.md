 ntolerance, sweating, increased appetite, diarrhea, weight loss, menstrual dysfunction 
 (oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea).


Graves: exophtalmos, lid retraction.
Ederly: new-onset atrial fibrillation, exacerbation of congestive heart failure

	ETIOLOGY
>Graves disease (diffuse toxic goiter): 80% to 90% of all cases of hyperthyroidism
>Toxic multinodular (Plummer disease)
>transient ([Hashimoto] or thyroiditis)
>rare: TSH (pituitary)

	DD
• Anxiety disorder
• Pheochromocytoma
• Metastatic neoplasm
• Diabetes mellitus
• Premenopausal state

	LAB:
T4L
TSH

	IMG:
24hs iodine radioactive uptake: Differentiate from uptake (Heterogeneous(Multinodular) vs homogeneous(GRAVES))

TREATMENT
	ANTITHYROID DRUGS (THIONAMIDES): Propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by blocking production of thyroid peroxidase (PTU and methimazole) or inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (PTU).
	PTU in pregnate (Methi can cause esophaegus atresia)
	Methi 15-30 mg/d; PTU 50-100mg q8h
		AE: skin rash, arthralgias, PTU: hepatic necrosis. Methi: jaudice cholestatic
		Always for 6 or 12m
	RADIOIODINE THERAPY
		>21y or ptes who not achieved remission after 1y
		>Contraindicated in pregnaci (risk of hypothiroidism
		High risk of postRAI hypothyroidism
	Surgical therapy (subtotal thyroidectomy)
		obstructive goiters; pregnacy; amiodarone induced hyperthyrodism
		Start [levothyroxine]] (1.7mcg/kg) before discharge from hospital
	Propanolol 20-40mg q6h controls
