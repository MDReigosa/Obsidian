Definition:
chronic inflammatory disease of the airway in which many cells and elements play a role.

	This inflammation causes recurrent episodes of coughing (particularly at night or early in the morning), wheezing, breathlessness, and chest tightness.
	Variable obstruction of the airway that is reversible either spontaneously or with treatment.
	Status asthmaticus is a refractory state that does not respond to beta agonist or subcutaneous epinephrine.

**Clinical findings during #statusasthmaticus**
	paradox pulse (inspiratory decline of 10mmHg during inspiration)
	abscense of wheezing (silent chest)
	mental changes: because of the hypoxia and hypercapnia: indication for intubation
	paradoxic respiration (abdominal)
	Tachycardia >120/min
	Tachypnea (>30)

Diagnosis
	For symptomatic adults and children age >5 yr who can perform spirometry, pre- and
	postbronchodilator spirometry is the recommended test of choice.
	***Airflow reversibility is defined as increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1 by at
	least 12% increase and 200 ml) after inhaling a short bronchodilator.***
	For <5y symptoms should be treated as having suspected asthma after alternative diagnosis were ruled out.
	negative spirometry is not diagnostic, patients with high clinical suspicious should undergo bronchial challenge with methacoline or other agent.

Medication

**Treatment of #statusasthmaticus**  is as follows:
	• Oxygen generally started at 2 to 4 L/min by nasal cannula or Venti-Mask at 40% Fio2;
	further adjustments are made according to oxygen saturations.
	• Bronchodilators: Initiate treatment with highdose SABA plus ipratropium bromide administered by means of a nebulizer every 20 min. Use of a metered-dose inhaler with
	valved holding chamber may be acceptable for patients with mild-to-moderate
	exacerbations.
	• Albuterol nebulizer solution (0.63 mg/3 ml, 1.25 mg/3 ml, 2.5 mg/3 ml, or 5.0 mg/ml):
	2.5 to 5 mg every 20 min over the first hr, then 2.5 to 10 mg every 1 to 4 hr as needed
	or 10 to 15 mg/hr continuously. Other useful medications are levalbuterol nebulizer solution
	(0.31 mg/3 ml, 0.63 mg/3 ml, 1.25 mg/3 ml) and ipratropium nebulizer solution (0.25/
	ml [0.025%]).
	• Corticosteroids:
	1. Early administration is advised, particularly
	in patients using steroids at home.
	2. Patients may be started on systemic corticosteroids; methylprednisolone, prednisone,
	or prednisolone may be used. Dose range is from 40-80 mg/day in one or two
	divided doses, generally given until peak expiratory flow reaches 70% of predicted
	value. Generally for corticosteroid courses <1 wk there is no need to taper the dose.
	No hydration IV at first for heart failure. IV antibiotics only if suspicion of bacterial infection (Xray-Leucocytosis)

Pearls:
	*prevent comorbid conditions (e.g., rhinosinusitis, vocal cord dysfunction, gastroesophageal
	reflux disease).*
	*Use of LABAs alone without use of a longterm asthma medication, such as an inhaled
	corticosteroid, is contraindicated. LABAs should also not be used in patients whose
	asthma is adequately controlled on lower medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids.
	Continued use of LABAs may cause downregulation of the beta-2 receptor with loss
	of the bronchoprotective effect from rescue therapy with a SABA.*
