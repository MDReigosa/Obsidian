Subgroup of smokers with COPD that shares some pathogenic and inflammatory characteristics with asthma
__Asthma with DLco <80% predicted, and *partially* reversible airflow obstruction.
__COPD with or without emphysema accompanied by reversible or partially reversible airflow obstruction__
Prevalence of 20%
60-70y. Age where asthmatics develops less reversability.

DX:
	Reversible airflow: Increase in FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) by â‰¥200 ml and 12% postbronchodilator challenge 
	Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR): A positive methacholine challenge test

[[Asthma]]: variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously
COPD: preventable and treatable disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible

TT: 
	The main interest in differentiating ACOS from COPD lies in the different response to inhaled corticosteroids
