In children
<10 days associated with fever, diarrhoea and or vomiting, where there is no evident cause for the symptoms
Prevention: rotaviru vaccine <6mths

Causes:
	virus (80%): rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus
	bacterial: c jejuni & salmonela. e. coli, shigella
	proto: g. lamblia, E. hystolitica
	food: staphylococcal toxin

***Dehydration from gastroenteritis is an important cause of death, particularly in obese infants***
Exclude appendicitis and intususeption in the very young

Clinic:
	anorexia, vomiting, fever, fluid stools, bleeding uncommon (bacterial), anal soreness
	Assess dehydration: urine output, level of thirst, pinched skin test. the most accurate way is to weigh the child.
	Classif:
		mild (up to 3%): normal signs
		moderate (3 to 9%): irritable, lethargic, dry mucous membranes, decreased urine
		severe < 9% dehydration: very sick child, no urine output
Managment:
	Drugs: antiemetics, atb
	lemonade. to rehydrate. 1:6 water
	Rehydration
		Fluid loss (mL) = % dehydration × body weight (kg) × 10
		Maintenance (mL/kg/24 h): 1–3 mth: 120 mL; 4–12 mth: 100 mL; >12 mth: 80 mL 
		Allow for continuing loss, e.g. 8-mth 10-kg child with 5% dehydration: fluid loss = 5 × 10 × 10 = 500 mL maintenance = 100 × 10 = 1000 mL 
		Total 24-h requirement (minimum) = 1500 mL
		Approximate average hrly requirement = 60 mL
		Aim to give more (replace fluid loss) in the first 6 hrs
		Rule of thumb: 100 mL/kg (infants) and 50 mL/kg (older children) in first 6 h
