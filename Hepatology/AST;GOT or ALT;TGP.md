Isolated elevation:
careful history- eliminate potential hepatotoxicity (alcohol and medications: NSAID;alcohol;statins;acetaminophen)

PE: suggest chronic liver disease
If
YES:
	DX evaluation for specific liver diseases:
	viral serologis
	genetic disease markers: transferrin saturation, ferritin, copper, antitripsin
	autoinmune: ANA, AMA, ASMA, ALKMA
	consider ct or US
RESULTS:
	[Negative]: Alcohol, obesity, DBT, hyperlipidemia as risk factors:
		yes? Steatohepatitis, No? unclear? biopsy
	[Positive]: consider liver biopsy to study stage.

NO:
	AST persistent elevated:
	YES: if also ALT elevated search for specific liver diseases. If NO possible non hepatic source (consider alcohol)
	NO: observe.
