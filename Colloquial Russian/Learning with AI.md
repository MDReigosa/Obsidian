Welcome to your first Russian lesson! In this lesson, we'll focus on greetings and introductions. Let's get started:

1. Greetings:
   - Transcription: Zdravstvuyte.
   - Translation: Hello.

2. How to introduce yourself:
   - Transcription: Menya zovut [Your Name].
   - Translation: My name is [Your Name].

3. Asking "How are you?":
   - Transcription: Kak dela?
   - Translation: How are you?

4. Responding to "How are you?":
   - Transcription: Horosho, spasibo.
   - Translation: I'm good, thank you.

Now, let's practice some dialogue:

You: Zdravstvuyte. (Hello)
Me: Zdravstvuyte. Kak dela? (Hello. How are you?)
You: Menya zovut [Your Name]. Horosho, spasibo. (My name is [Your Name]. I'm good, thank you.)

Great job! You've just learned the basic greetings and introductions in Russian. Remember to practice these phrases regularly to build your confidence.

For your homework, I'd like you to create a short dialogue introducing yourself to someone and asking how they are. Feel free to use the phrases we've learned so far.

I'll be here to provide feedback and answer any questions you may have. Keep up the excellent work, and I look forward to our next lesson!
