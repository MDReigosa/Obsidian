Three stages:
Stage One (also called “mild” dementia), sees the person’s cognition or thinking affected prominently. This may include impairment or changes in memory, judgement, planning, mood, and insight. The family or the person with dementia may be seeking a diagnosis at this early stage. 

Stage Two (also known as “moderate” dementia), involves an increase in the symptoms of Stage One, along with the appearance of some new symptoms. Further impairment of memory, communication, mood, insight, orientation, perception, judgement, and the onset of psychological and behavioural symptoms, are all likely to be more apparent in Stage Two. 

Stage Three (or “advanced dementia”), sees progressive impairment of nerve impulses effectively working on muscles. This affects mobility, chewing and swallowing, continence, and other physical functions. The person is likely to need progressive assistance with all activities of daily living at this stage.
