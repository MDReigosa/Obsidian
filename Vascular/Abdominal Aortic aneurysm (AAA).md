Ferris

Clasif: ruptured or non-ruptured
Definition: dilation of the abdominal aortic artery to at least 1.5 times the diameter measured at the level of the renal arteries .
> 3cm is aneurysm

AAAs â‰¥4 cm are present in 1% of men between age 55 and 64 higher in smokers than in nonsmokers (8:1)

2 to 4 times more common in first-degree male relatives of known AAA
#Diabetes lows risk

Rupture of the AAA occurs in 1% to 3% of men age 65 or older.  
Rupture is the **10th** leading cause of death in men older than age 55.

	ETIOLOGY
Degenerative: tobacco, atherosclersis
inherited: marfan, Ehler danlos
Infectious: mycotic: syphilis

	NATURAL HISTORY
90% dies before hospital

	SCREENING
US in 65-75 one time or in 60y if family history
Control every 6ms for > 5cm. 12m for 4cm

	CLINICAL
PE: has a sensitivity of 76% for detecting AAAs >5 cm and only 29% for AAAs 3.0 to 3.9 cm.
prominent femoral and popliteal pulses warrant an abdominal ultrasound
*TRIAD: abdominal or back pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass in 50% of patients*

ALGORITHM
![[Pasted image 20220829234515.png]]

	DIF DX
mesenteric ischemia; renal calculi; pyelonefritis; diverticulitis; peptic ulcer

	LAB
Dimer-d may indicate thrombus within the aneurysm

	IMG
US; CT (IV CTE IS NOT REQUIRED TO DX OF RUPTURED)

	TREATMENT
attend risk factors

ACUTE Rx: EVAR (endovascular) or surgical (EVAR is better but requires reinterventions)
CHRONIC Rx: protection vascular (atorvastatin; BB)

*CONSIDERATIONS*
>Repairing asymptomatic AAAs smaller than 5.5 cm has not been shown to improve survival because the risk of rupture is lower than the risk of surgery.
