Age 50-60y
Risk: hypertension, dyslipidemia, DBT, smoking

Clinical:
Carotid bruit: indicator of generalized  atherosclerosis
TIA: amaurosis fugax, contralateral focus

Laboratory: 
	CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, fasting lipid profile, PT/international normalized ratio, APTT, HgA1C.

Imaging:
	Cerebral Angiography Gold standard
	carotid duplex: sensitive in high grade stenosis (>70%)
	MRA: sensitive in high grade stenosis (>70%)
	CTA
NO SCREENING

Treatment:
3 antiplatelett (aspirin, clopidogrel) + *statins?*
Carotid endarterectomy /Angioplasty and stent

Asymptomatic patient:
Guide: asymptomatic patients with >70% stenosis if the anticipated perioperative risk is less than 3%
Symptomatic patient:
	Non-disabling ischemic stroke or TIA in the preceding 6 mo, + severe stenosis >70% 
	perioperative stroke or mortality is <6%.
	non-disabling ischemic stroke or TIA in the preceding 6 mo, and who have moderate carotid stenosis (50 to 69%).

CEA is preferred over CAS in older patients.
For patients undergoing CAS, dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for a minimum of 30 days.
